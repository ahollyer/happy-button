# Happy Button

Push the button to text yourself (or others) a motivational quote.

Uses [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) and [Forismatic](https://forismatic.com/en/) quote API.

I used an [esp32 dev board](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-devkitc/overview). An esp8266 would work fine too.

This is a mod to the [AWS IoT button project](https://github.com/mongoose-os-apps/aws-iot-button) from Mongoose OS.
